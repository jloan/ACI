# Reflection Prompt:

Take 5 minutes and compose a reflection that will help you ask questions about your ecology that youâ€™ve mapped.

* How has the Q&A session impacted how you see your ecology now?

The core idea of "access to every grade" in the course is interesting

* What do you notice about your current ecology that you want to share with your group in our next session?

I think my ecology

* What questions would you like to pose to your group about your ecology as it currently exists?

# Questions from Q&A

## What is the single most important, non-negotiable aspect of an antiracist assessment ecology?

All students -- regardless of any factors -- have access to all the grades of the course.

This includes disparities in equitable access to time for the labor. Is making the realities of constraints "present" or "visible" enough?

We have to have real negotiations in place at various points of the course -- what's going on? what have we not accounted for in our original estimation of labor?

The best grade possible given the constraints.

Try to shift the focus from grades -- i.e. how do I get the highest grade possible with the least amount of effort...

Think about education as a social contract...social vs. individual contracts/assessments

How do I account for time in my ecology?

labor = learning is the key assumption in this...

...labor instructions...vs. prompts...?????


How does it come to be that....


## How do you begin this work -- what's the first area we can begin to make changes in our course?

Grades....

## How can we prepare our labor-based grading students with an exit ecology that prepares them for non-labor-based instructors?

We need to help students be self-aware of this -- of the conditions of their existential writing conditions...

## How do we account for how the material conditions of our students at the community colleges impacts their access to labor?

## Should the amount of labor a teacher expects from a student to earn a particular grade line up with the general expectation that one credit hour = one hour of in-class work and two hours out of class per week? Is this amount of labor generally negotiable?

## Are the contracts really very different each quarter? When you negotiate with each group, do they largely end up mostly the same, but it's socially constructed by the participants and that makes it meaningful? Or do the rubrics actually vary quite widely depending on each cohort of students?

## How much time/labor should students and the teacher expect to spend on negotiating labor contracts and rubrics? How can I compress these methods into the timespan of a 10-week quarter? Do they, in essence, become the content of the course?

## How does quality factor into student writing?

## How can we teach or write antiracist assignments and topics without being patriarchal or judgmental while encouraging students to use their authentic voice and the English they feel most comfortable?  

## How much has your approach changed from when you started, and how has it evolved since writing this?

## What are some ways that your conception of labor-based grading has evolved since writing AWAE?

## What are some methods you have used (or would like to try) for sharing labor-based grading information (and antiracist pedagogy and practices) with colleagues who are skeptical or in opposition (rather than supportive or curious)?
