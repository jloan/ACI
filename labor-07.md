Draft a post on Canvas addressed to your colleagues in this forum. Your post should have two parts. (45 minutes)

**Part 1:** Using your PowerNotes, discuss what you think right now makes for a meaningful theory of classroom assessment. Explain why and you might also identify any places you are not sure about, questions that you don’t know exactly how to answer. Of course, you can add to or question ideas from the book, but please start your thinking there with what Inoue offers. End with a question that comes out of your discussion of what a meaningful theory of classroom assessment involves.


I can start by saying I actually think "writing assessment as ecology" does make for a meaningful theory of writing assessment. Asao's articulation of this theory has generally resonated with me because my own approach (theory?) of classroom writing assessment could be glossed, awkwardly for sure, like this -- "classroom writing assessment as situational awareness." In another moment I might also gloss my approach as "writing assessment as rhetorical awareness." For me the concept of rhetorical situation (Bitzer et al) or more contemporarily rhetorical ecologies (Edbauer/Rice) has in some way or another been central to my pedagogy, the assignments in my classes, and the assessment processes I try to engage in with students. In many ways this has meant that I have tried to ask students to intentionally work within and develop an awareness of the "ecology" of things that might give their writing meaning both to themselves and others. So while Asao's work offers an ecological view of the big picture assessment landscape, I've tried in my own assessment practices to co-create a space for the judgments myself and students might make about a piece of writing (or language) within the larger context of the rhetorical situations/ecologies that might give that act of writing and communication meaning in the world.  This plays out in multiple ways. One way, and perhaps the primary one, is I have moved away, as best I can, from valuing the more traditional framings of the academic essay (or paper) as an assignment in the class. And by "more traditional framing" I generally mean the sort of essay designed solely to be written for the teacher in the context of the class. (There's certainly lots of complexity here that I'm always happy to unpack with folks at any point.) Instead, I've tried to design assignments/projects that ask students to start thinking situationally about the potential process/act of writing and communicating -- things like purpose, audience, context, genre -- in order to inform the choices they might make in writing/communicating in the context of the class. The process of assessing this work is then rooted primarily in student self-assessment (coupled with feedback from me and ideally other readers). I ask students to reflect on the ways their developing situational awareness have informed the choices that brought their writing into existence. Another way of thinking about this might be that the "rubrics" for a particular project in my classrooms are focused less on the particular criteria of particular writing product (essay, etc.) and are instead focused on situational layers. To be fair, I really don't use rubrics in there traditional sense. For example, assessing a proect I'd ask the students, myself, and other readers of the project to describe something like -- "How has the writing conformed to - or not -- the conventions that have become expected by readers in this genre?" This question can be asked and explored about traditional academic essays as well less conventional academic texts like podcasts or more Montaigne-esque essays. I want to note here that this process of question posing as assessment work very much connects to Asao's discussion of  [single-point rubrics](http://asaobinoue.blogspot.com/2015/07/thinking-about-one-point-rubrics.html) and that has been helpful in me experimenting with variations on how to engage in this work with students and as a reader of studnets' writing.

I think what makes this "situational" approach to writing assessment (theory?) meaningful is that it has the potential to, for example, address notions of "quality" in conjunction with *what constructs these judgements of quality* and this is done in dialogue with the student rather than the teacher simply imposing the judgement of quality. It for me, has helped establish assessment as as much a multidimensional process as the process of writing itself. That's what I've always found most valuable or as having the most potential. It also, at least for me, has helped me to invite students to begin to consider what sorts of writing has meaning for them and to consider that ways writing has meaning in the world outside of the always seemingly arbitrary "paper."

As I mentioned above, all of this can be unpacked further, and I'm happy to do that and imagine we will over the course of our work, but hopefullt this provides a reasonable snap shot.

Another reason I find "writing assessment as situational awareness" meaningful has to do with the second part of our prompt. I think that in rooting our assessment of student writing in the process of a developing situational awareness of the writing itself we have the opportunity to intentionally bring the realities of race and racism into our assessment work. And for this remains a key struggle challenge -- intentionally designing assessment as an antiracist project. For me, I began designing my "situational" approach not in order to design an intentionally antiracist project -- although I don't think desires for and activism around equity were absent. My situational approach was rooted in my desire to provide what I hoped was a more authentic landscape of compositional possibility. Maybe some background here. I came into teaching somewhat randomly. I was not an English major. I have fine arts degrees in film production and writing (which I did prior to graduate work in composition studies). So I was never particularly precious about "academic writing," but was instead always way more interested in the ways technology (computers, prosumer audio-video technologies, photocopiers, etc.) interacted with the writing done by everyday people in response to their own social needs and desires...all this is a long story...this is just to say you never had to twist my arm very hard to embrace an expansive (maybe even radical by some standards) notion of writing and communication, to embrace one that didn't only privilege the discursive forms of a white, middle-class habitus, even before I had any terminology like *habitus* to help my understanding of this.

That said, I do continue to struggle and am incredibly uncertain about how to be transparent in my assessment process is when it comes to race and racism. The design is open to this for sure, and I haven't completely put my head in the sand with some notion that "situations/ecologies" are neutral, but I've struggled to be as intentional as I am sure I could be.

Another bit about my background. When I did finally start teaching it was in the New York City Public Schools. I was a white teacher with a class -- and in a school -- that served a student body that would almost entirely identify as black and brown people. When I started working in that context I don't think I had a theory of race but I did believe that race (or at least our understanding of it) was constructed and that racism was primarily a systemic problem, although I didn't have the language for that back then. Since that time until now I think my understanding of race (as a construct) and racism (as systemic) has remained consistent while becoming incrementally more sophisticated and nuanced. Work's like Asao's have been part of this process for sure.






Part 2: In a second part of your post, which you can make as a new section or an ending paragraph, discuss what your theory of race and racism is at the moment, and how the parts of Inoue’s book so far are helping you think about that theory. Of course, keep your discussion connected closely to your writing classroom and students. Again, if there are places or things you are less sure about, you can pose them as questions not yet answered for you. Your entire post (parts 1 and 2) should be at least 600 words in length. Give your post a catchy title, and post by . Your colleagues will reply to you and you may have a discussion on Canvas.
