# ACI - Mapping My Assessment Ecology

Hi, my name is Jason.

I'm an Associate Professor of English at Pierce College (WA).

This repository contains my work to draft an assessment ecology for my English 101 course. This work is being done as part of an Antiracist Curriculum Initiative in the WA State Community College system.

For more info on the model of antiracist writing assessment ecologies being used in this process see Asao Inoue's [Antiracist Writing Assessment Ecologies: Teaching and Assessing Writing for a Socially Just Future (2015)](https://wac.colostate.edu/books/perspectives/inoue/).
