People.
# Guiding Questions
* How are the various people involved in writing assessment (students, teacher, outside readers or experts) defined in the ecology and what are their roles?

*Teacher (me):* Sets the general context for the parts of the class. Both defines general guidelines and expectations for assignments and prompts students to define sets of criteria for work both individually and collectively. May also share their own drafts of materials like positionality statements, etc.

*A Writing Center tutor:* Participates in class sessions (both online and in-person) and is available for office hours both individually and in in joint hours with teacher and course librarian.  Dialogues with students at various stages of project work. May also share their own drafts of materials like positinality statements, etc.

*A course librarian:* Participates in class sessions (both online and in-person) and is available for office hours both individually and in in joint hours with teacher and course librarian.  Dialogues with students at various stages of project work. May also share their own drafts of materials like positinality statements, etc.

*Students:* Engage in project frameworks designed by teacher. Expected to make choices regarding the development of writing and research projects/processes and reflect on choices made within these frameworks to articulate learning.


* How are their various literacy histories and dispositions with English acknowledged, reflected upon, and used to help judge writing and think about writing as (counter)hegemonic?

Students are specifically asked to engage in processes of developing positionality statements and reflections on grading and writing about elements of literacy hisotro and dispositions with English. I also share in the context of these conversations. Additionally, part of grounding all the project work in the goal of developing a situational awareness of ours and others writing is to contextualize our own and others judgements often in the context of our histories and dispositions with English.


# Interconnection.
How are the people of the ecology (i.e., students, teacher) interconnected in explicit ways? How is any individual’s success or failure in any activity connected explicitly to his peers’ success or failure? How are students encouraged to see or explore the ways assessment is a diverse ecology that is about cultivating a livable and sustainable place together for everyone?
# Local Diversity.
How are the locally diverse students and teacher in the ecology used to understand the local white racial habitus? In what ways might the local diversity help construct difference in writing as more than the expectations, and help link that value added to writers and readers? What methods or processes are in place to help students understand their own habitus and ways of judging and valuing writing, reflect upon those habitus, and discuss them as a part of the dispositions used in the assessment processes of the course?
# Inter-being as Problem-Posing.
How do various people participate in the assessment processes and the construction of the ecological parts, purposes, and products? How might the ecology help students experience the interconnected nature of all the elements in the ecology so that the lessons learned are ones about one’s own existential writing assessment situation in a socially structured and hegemonic historic bloc? In other words, how do you help students see that lessons about what a rubric (a part) means are also lessons about their own individual reading and writing practices, lessons about choices and degrees of consent to larger structural forces, to the hegemonic? How do you help students see their own ways of judging language as determined (both constrained and pressured) in particular directions?
