# Part 1:

In thinking about the first part of this prompt, I keep returning the idea of having students "problematize their own existential writing situations," which appears again in this chapter and ultimately grounds the assessment ecology. And what becomes clear, I think, in the current chapter is that this is really a multidirectional process, meaning that not only does this framework require the process of students problematizing -- and they are doing this themselves as a network -- but it equally asks (invites? demands?) the teacher to also problematize their existential pedagogical situation, to be a node in the ecology. I was struck by the moment of recognition/reflection Inoue has in response a student (Ashe's) reflection. He writes:

"I  may  be  assuming  wrongly  that  Ashe  requires  full,  unfettered  power and agency in order to develop as a writer and reader, that my validation is somehow either unnecessary or harmful to her. I’ve made these arguments to students  before,  but  Ashe  complicates  these  assumptions.  Her  reflection  suggests,  I  think,  that  maybe  this  isn’t  the  best  assumption  to  make  about  what’s  best  for  Ashe’s  growth  as  a  writer.  I  might  be  leaving  her  without  any  oar  or  anchor in a choppy sea of discourse if I didn’t offer some ideas and validation, validation that none of the monolingual students seemed to require from me" (202-203).

Inoue is able to notice his students differing relations to the elements of the ecology -- power, processes, parts, places, etc. -- because of the valuing the process/work of reflection as the primary methodology for problematizing the writing/learning/laboring situation. But for the first time I'm recognizing that it's more than this, more than just prompting reflection. It seems that it's that the reflective work is rooted in the concept of labor that potentially gives the reflective work it's particular power in this ecology.

Over the course of this chapter I feel somewhat validated in my own valuing of reflection as a key site for learning and action in my courses. That said, the note I found myself most making was something like *I think my asking students to reflect tries to do this in theory...in practice I wonder if my current prompts just seem like busy work to the student, etc.*...I mean I want my reflective work, and the work I ask students to do, to do things like  "allow[] locally diverse students and teacher to share in the ontological essence of others’ writing, no matter how different that writing is from our own writing or from our expectations of it" (190) but it's certainly not, I know, doing that now. I think in part, I'm realizing that the reflective work I've asked students to do general has lacked a a clear ground, or intention. Labor is that ground for Inoue, and I'm starting to see the role of the concept of labor a bit more clearly in his ecology.

So, the question that I'm asking myself (or one of them) at this point -- Why might labor be unique it's power to promote a *sharing in the ontological essence of others' writing*? To "help us feel as we judge" (190)?


# Part 2:

In a second part of your post, which you can make as a new section, reflect on how Asao's discussion of his own classroom assessment ecologies help you think through your antiracist assessment ecologies and practices. How does chapter 4 help you think about what you need to build for your course assessments? Like last time, keep your discussion connected closely to your writing classroom and students. Again, if there are places or things in the text you are less sure about, you can pose them as questions not yet answered for you.  While you are free to respond as much (or as little) as you like, we recommend your entire post (parts 1 and 2) be at least 600 words in length OR a 5-10 minute audio/video.

Asao's discussion prompts me to think that in my own assessment ecology I tend to think of everything (more) as parts. A moment came in his discussion of the development of project and writers' rubrics where he acknowledges his own failure to take full advantage of that process of co-development -- "In retrospect, I missed opportunities to take full advantage of the writer’s rubric as an ecological part that developed more intense, engaged, and productive student labors. I missed this because I saw it more as a part, rather than a place of problematizing, a borderland" (223). What's really interesting (and challenging) here is this sense of "more than" (which was introduced earlier in the book). Rubrics are a *part* but they are also, or can be, a *place*. I think in my own assessment ecologies, even when I'm being rather intentional in the design, I tend to reduce things, or don't often explore how things are multiple. That parts might also be places, each both what it is and more than what it is.

Another thing I'm aware of in this chapter's discussion is how much I've gotten away from the collaborative design elements that is essential to Inoue's assessment ecologies. I believe I need to return to -- to build -- more places where students can do this. And at thie risk of revealing my own misunderstadning of parts and places etc., I think I've gotten away from this, in part, because I've convinced myself that it's too logistically challenging especially in a fully online class. this is an example of me seeing a rubric (or assignment) as more of a *part* rather a *place*, or "locations that de(con)fine people and their learning, locations of shock and change" (176). How might a rubric be a location of shock and change?
