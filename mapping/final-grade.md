# How is a final grade assigned in your class?

In short, final grades in the class are determined by student self-evaluation. This evaluation is coupled with discussions of grades (and our conceptions of them) and an attempt to sketch out a general "rubric" or set of elements that might guide us in assigning a letter grade for the course.

This is the language used to provide an overview of this from my most recent English 101 syllabus:

## Here’s where we talk grades…

Here’s where we talk grades…

The assessment plan for our course involves a high degree of trust. You trusting me, and me trusting you. My promise is to trust you. And hopefully as we work together you will trust me.

Our class will conduct assessment using a two-fold process of feedback and self-evaluation. This system is meant to value your labor and the work you do to fully engage the course. My intention in using this system is to offer each of us a chance to experience writing and learning not as a strictly finite task that is either already mastered or simply needs to be mastered, but instead as an ongoing act of dialogue, invention, risk taking, concern for others, and, yes, even failure. My intention is to facilitate as close as we can a classroom-as-studio approach in which we each play a generative role in one another’s learning.

## Determining Final Grades

I'll set every assignment (big or small) to be generally assessed as "Complete" or "Incomplete." I will mark an assignment "Complete" if its submitted and generally meets any minimal requirements that were spelled out (ex: add 3 annotations and reply to 2 of your peers'). I will mark something as "Incomplete" if nothing has not been submitted. If a submission is really off the mark or something major is missing I will mostly likely mark this "Incomplete" and reach out to see how I can support your work.

In addition to simply attempting the assignments and projects I offer you, the main way we will determine grades in this class is through self-reflection and self-assessment. As a class we will develop some baseline expectations for what we believe it means to earn a particular letter grade (i.e. “A,” “B,” “C,” etc.). We'll also get a chance to discuss the quality of our work via feedback and dialogue. The grades, then, will emerge primarily through a guided self-assessment of your learning. These are not easy to do, and I will help you as best I can to make your learning and knowledge visible.


## Late Work

I'm generally flexible with late work and I accept it, so if an assignment hasn't been turned in at the deadline I don't tend to panic, and trust that the student has a good reason for a late submission. If after a couple of days past the due date an assignment still hasn't been turned in, I will mark it "Incomplete" and reach out. I'll do this just so myself and the student can track what work might be missing so we can make a plan of action for moving forward. Even if something is initially marked "Incomplete" you can still turn it in, and I'll change the status to "Complete".

## Why I Assess the Way I Do

My assessment process is most likely new to you. Much of your schooling has probably done the opposite of what I attempt in this class. It most likely has emphasized points and letter grades and rankings.

A good introduction to my assessment process can be found in this [podcast interview](https://teachinginhighered.com/podcast/ungrading/) with Susan Blum on "Ungrading." Much of what she discusses and cites here very much informs my own approach. I'll ask you to take a closer look at this podcast as we begin to write our first self-assessments/reflections, but it might also be worth a first listen now as you are getting familiar with the course.

Grading often requires us to over-simplify the otherwise complex processes of learning, processes that require from us a commitment to experimentation, to ambiguity, to taking risks, to listening and responding.

The challenge of writing (or composing) is that it is a highly situational activity. This means that what specifically “works” in one situation or with one reader does not necessarily “work” in another situation or with other readers. Another way of saying this is that writing and our responses to it are always highly subjective. This subjectivity is complex. This complexity is acknowledged in our course outcomes as they ask us to consider how all writing is a “purposeful response to a variety of situations and contexts as well as products of social identity (e.g., gender, ethnicity, sexuality, and social class).”

This makes the problem of teaching and learning to write a difficult and, I think, very interesting one. Because of this difficulty we tend, as teachers and students, to rely on two basic methods. One is sometimes called “recipe swapping.” We share with each other tips and tricks and “recipes” for success. “Hey, this worked for me – try it.” The other method is usually some form of “standardization” or what might be called a “canned” approach. We approach writing as if it has a universal situation, and as if a set of hard-and-fast rules will always help us navigate this situation successfully. (For example, if you’ve ever been told to never use “I” in an essay, you’ve experienced a variation of this sort of approach.) The problem, however, with both these paths is that they tend to ignore, or at least side-step, the complexities of writing as a situational and subjective activity. What we know about writing is that what we might call “successful” writers are those that tend to become aware of the general conventions and expectations for the kind of writing they are doing -- given the purposes they have for doing it in the first place. And with this awareness these writers are better able to navigate the situational and subjective nature of their writing situations. They do this by being able to make their experiences with writing actionable. We make experience actionable via processes that encourage reflection and self-assessment.

In this class, the goal of our assessment process is to, as best we can, try to explicitly work within both the subjective and situational experiences of writing. To do this we will rely on reflection coupled with self-assessment and feedback.  

Hopefully this provides the start of some more clarity -- and maybe even reassurance -- if needed. Again, an assessment system like this very much requires trust. You trusting me and me trusting you. I know trust can be hard and is a process, so I'm willing to talk with you as much as you want about these things as any anxieties or challenges emerge.
