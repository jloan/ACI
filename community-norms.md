1. What kinds of behaviors and agreements will help us achieve community?

I've come value prioritizing listening as a foundational behavior for community building. I suppose we could add some adjectives to this -- active listening, open listening, intentional listening but admittedly I'm not sure how I would define these in the moment, and that are probably concepts best defined collectively and in light of the ongoing experience of that collective.

Maybe more specifically, an agreement (and behavior) that would help us value listening is that to expect that the primary goal of the first person to speak within a conversation is to invite some else to speak, and maybe even invite that someone to help us begin by recounting what they think they've heard in work/conversation/information that is the focus of our concern. And this "what I'm hearing..." is good way to begin any response to the activity of the community. Maybe there's something in working from a place of "This is what I'm hearing..." rather than  "This is what I think..." (which always feels to me like things are already settled).

I agree to listen first. And if called on or moved to speak first I agree to begin with what I'm hearing.

2. What kind of behaviors might cause unintentional harm? What behaviors should we avoid?  

In light of my above sense, I certainly think not prioritizing listening can cause unintentional harm. As best we can we want to avoid being in a space where we assume we know what our colleagues are thinking or what their perspectives are.

3. What if someone breaks a norm?  How should we handle it?

I think the challenge is that we have to first have the courage and sensitivity to call out the breaking of the norm, in the moment. The risk of conflict in the moment doesn't out weigh the potential for larger issues to develop if norms are broken. If this isn't possible, or advisable, for whatever reason, then reaching out to those breaking norms to have a conversation would also be a good way to handle it.

And even if it seems that norms are not being broken, or there's no obvious rupture -- it's worth doing regular check-in's with the various large and small groups of community to make clear the ways that individuals are experiencing the norms, which I imagine will often have nuances in how people try to practice them.
