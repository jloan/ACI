Places.  

* What ecological places (figurative or real) are created through the judgment of writing or the assessment processes students enact?
* What attention is paid to the places created in the ecology and can students reflect on the conditions and effects of those places?
* Where do students inhabit or dwell in the ecology and what are the effects or consequences of dwelling in those places? What places are created by judgments of writing and how do students engage in conflict in those places?
* Are there ways in which the places your ecology creates become places that unconsciously or unreflectively norm students to some universal standard, such as a white racial habitus?
* Are there places in your ecology that are constructed by the presence of mostly students of color, places where mostly multilingual students inhabit, where Blacks or Latinos/as inhabit? How much control do students have in creating or changing the places created by the ecology, for naming them, critiquing them, resisting them, establishing the processes or labor that constitute them, or identifying what they get from those places?
* How is that control formally designed into the ecology and how much attention is paid to the ways those places are controlled?


Some places:

* Canvas, our institution's LMS. Canvas both creates the places for judgements (gradebook, assignment submission areas, etc.) and is created by the assessment processes. The need for discussion boards for example, is created via the need to discuss collectively (or in small groups) to say discuss our conceptions of grades, literacy histories and disposition towards English.

* Zoom. In pandemic times both whole class sessions and individual meet-ups/conferences as well as office hours are in this place. The Zoom place also involves such connected spaces as bedrooms, living rooms, cars, lap tops, hotels, phones, backyards, etc. "Break out" rooms in Zoom.

* Classrooms. My classes have consistently met in a computer lab. This on the one hand has offered a space where we can do hands on writing work in a digital space, and support each other in working with composition spaces like Google Drive or Canvas. On the other, the lab set-up makes it a bit more difficult to arrange ourselves into discussion groups as the desktop computers are spatially arranged lecture-class style. That said, we are able to get into small in-[person working groups.

* The library. Increasingly my English 101 courses have an embedded librarian, which in many ways brings the library as a place more consistently into the classroom both in-person and virtually. I wouldn't say that this presence of the library/librarian "norms" the students to a particular standard, except that it does establish that research is a "norm" within the work of a writing class at the college, while we hope also normalizes the processes of working socially with librarians.

* The writing center. Similarly, I often teach 101 courses that have an embedded tutor, which in many ways brings the Writing Center into the classroom in both physical and virtual ways. Same idea about "norm" here...one of the goals we have in using embedded tutors and librarians in these courses is that it creates "support" as a "norm" -- that it's normal to work with librarians and tutors and that these processes do not represent remediation activities.

* The web more broadly as a primary site of publication and engagement with texts.



#Writing groups.

Do students work in consistent writing groups, or different ones each week? How many students make up those places? How are those places composed or designed? Do you hand-pick in order to ensure diverse writing groups? Do students have a say in their creation, or in their on-going cultivation? How much reflection is done on the dynamics of their writing groups, and what happens with those reflections afterwards? How is trust and respect built into the writing group dynamics?

Students do work in writing groups, and the goal is to keep these as consistent as possible, with students staying in the same over the course of a project if not the entire quarter. Groups tend to be between 3 - 5 students in size, and I do not typically hand-pick them to ensure diversity. Often, groups are initially formed somewhat randomly based on the early ways that students arrange themselves in the class. As project ideas develop, I will (re)arrange groups based on some of the situational factors of the writing -- topics, purposes, genres -- and have students with somewhat resonate projects work together. I do faciliate some initial conversations around group dynamics and working with trust and respect. I also think that facilitating and making visible connections between projects can do this also.


#Failure and Success.
How is failure constructed as a place in the ecology? How often can students fail at writing (either publically or privately)? How is success constructed and how often are students positioned in the place of success? Is success public or private? Are there grades? If so, how do your grading practices construct places in which students are positioned, and then become inherent to that place? Do you offer any formal moments in the course to ask students about how failure and success are created in the class, in their writing, in their labors, or how the nature of success and failure have changed for them?

Failure tends to be constructed as a place of "did not submit." Generally, full-credit is given to all attempts at the tasks asked for, and even when a task is submitted but in someways incomplete, this does not result in a failure but rather in a conversation about the nature of the "incompleteness" and making a plan to move forward, either by redesigning the task to better fit a particular writers' need or project, or offering more guidance in the existing expectation. In the syllabus and in course conversation in general, we tend to talk of the productive "failures" of trying things out, that in our project work and drafts we may ideas, goals and intentions that we do not reach, and we talk about what this means -- how/why particular choices may or may not have contributed to a particular judgement by a reader of the writer themselves about the work/writing.

#Texts.
How are the places of texts, particularly those used as examples for discussion (either published or student texts), constructed relative to the expectations of the course, which often are a product of a white racial habitus? Are published texts used as model places only? How are those same textual places compared to (set against, set next to) the locally diverse habitus of students that organically occur in the classroom and in student writing? Is race made present in the writing and authors of published examples or “models”? Are there ways that white textual places and textual places of color might be juxtaposed so that students might problematize those places and their writer’s ethos?

I think this is an answer to this question -- my goal is always to use example texts that come from out there in the "wilds" of various places people might write/communicate. These examples might range from essays published online in magazines like Hanif Abdurraquib's [On Seatbelts and Sunsets](https://trianglehouse.squarespace.com/review/issue-four/on-seatbelts-and-sunsets) or Kaiya Gordon's [Intake Essay](https://trianglehouse.squarespace.com/review/issue-twenty/intake-essay) in Triangle House to online archives/projects the [POC Zine Project](https://poczineproject.tumblr.com/) to [The Journal of Undergraduate Multimedia Projects](https://jumpplus.net/). I think these places -- say the POC Zine Project and another database project like [The Electric Typewriter](https://tetw.org/) can be juxtaposed a means for problematizing these places and their writer's ethos.
