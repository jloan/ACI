# Guiding Questions

* What processes, work, or labor will students do each day or week that contribute to, feed into, or create the parts, products, or places of the ecology?

* What processes do you plan for or anticipate students doing in order to read, make judgments, then articulate and disseminate those judgments to writers?

* What processes occur because of or after those articulations (e.g., discussions, revisions/rethinking, reflections)?

* How are processes or labor accounted for in the calculation of course grades?

* What processes are used to do assessment? How are judgments accomplished and what happens with them? How is assessment and judgements done? What steps or actions are taken?

The two "major" processes are intertwined -- students propose and develop a research process/project that underpins the entire course and develop at least one writing project (sometimes two) from this research. These processes are designed so that if students produce the parts of these process -- produce a writing project responding to a situation of their choosing -- and documenting their research (in one of a variety of ways) they will have demonstrated work that meets the course outcomes (determined by the department). Typically the wekly work has "minor" elemnets that support these "major" processes each week and there are "check ins" for these processes, typically around the mid-term, then about 3/4's of the way through the quarter, and then final submissions of materials.

A handful of "minor" processes also are developed in the course.

* Participating in discussions of text and key concepts of the class (writing is situational, etc.) in either face-to-face groups or online forums depending on the modality, sometimes its a mix of both.
* regular reflections on work being produced, connected to the course learning outcomes and students' understanding of those as well to conceptions of grades and the kind of labor or evidence that might render those judgements viable.
* Readings -- some as part of ones research process and self-selected and some that are assigned by me in conjunction with course concepts and outcomes. In terms of assigned readings, most are designed to help students writing situations -- seeing the situational nature of others' writing and attempting to ultimately apply that thinking to their own project designs.
* Engaging with classmates work. Similiar in approach to the readings of "example" texts from out in the world -- judgements rooted in trying to better understand the situation that has produced the work of their peers.

I want to sat a little about rubrics here I think. I don;t use rubrics a ton, or at least I don't use traditinal rubrics much. I tend

# Rubric-Building.

How are the codes and expectations for writing (the rubric) constructed, articulated to students, and justified to them as appropriate expectations of the course? Can your rubric(s) be an articulation of something other than standards, such as a set of dimensions worth exploring and questioning, a starting point, not end point? What role do students play in the creation or revision of the rubric and writing assignments? How does the rubric address, identify, or name the dispositions it promotes as a part of a white racial habitus? How are students’ habitus made apparent and used as a critical comparative lens to critique the rubric? Is the rubric (or the course’s writ- ing expectations) set up as static or do they change during the course of the semester? Are there processes in place that help encourage and discuss those changes? Are students a part of those processes?

# Feedback.

How do students create feedback for peers’ writing? What do students do with feedback or assessments? How is difference and conflicting judgments created or manufactured in feedback processes? How do students confront difference and conflict, particularly in the judgments on their writing? How are the goals of that confrontation in processes expressed (are they about finding agreement or under- standing difference and perspectives)? Do students dialogue or revise their original judgments and feedback after discussing them face to face? How do the processes of reading and judgment help students to articulate a white racial habitus as an arbitrary set of expectations for making meaning and communicating? How are they led to understand, then articulate their own habitus used to judge writing?

# Reflection.

Are there on-going reflective processes that ask students to make sense of peer reviews, rubric building activities, or your feedback? How do the processes of reflecting help students toward a problematizing of their existential writing assessment situations?

How do these reflection processes show them a way to consider their own habitus in reading and writing as a habitus, as a set of historically determined dispositions that they don’t have complete control over, and that are not inherently better or worse than the dominant habitus of the academy or western society?

# Labor monitoring.

Are there ways students can keep track of their labor, its duration, frequency, and intensity? How might students reflect upon their labor practices in order to interrogate them as a part of their habitus? What patterns might students look for in their labor practices that might tell them something about their language practices, or their reading practices, or what they can (or are able to) read and value in texts? Are there ways to compare students’ labor practices, not find ideal practices, but notice the diverse ways students attend to the course processes?
